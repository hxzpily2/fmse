# Issues

1. Base64 encoding doesn't work in Safari's web workers, following error is in the console `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: btoa`
1. Player stucks for some time and then playback continues. Looks like buffer control problem -- segments are not fetch during playback to compensate buffer depletion.
1. No playback controls
1. Not sure if volume control works
1. Not sure if seeking works(very likely that it doesn't)
1. Add support of multiple polyfill instances
